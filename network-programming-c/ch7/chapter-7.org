* Chapter 7

** HTTP Server
The internet can be a hostile environment. Production-grade web servers need to include security in layers and be meticulous about file access and resource allocation.

*** Content Types
It's the HTTP server's job to tell the client the type of the content being sent through use of the ~Content-Type~ header.

If the file's media type is unknown, our server should use ~application/octet-stream~ by default so the browser knows to treat the content as an unknown binary blob

*** Security and robustness
One of the most important rules when developing networked code is your program should never trust the connected peer.

Run your networked programs under non-privileged accounts that have access to only the minimum resources needed to function.
